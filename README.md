Code used for the Master Thesis ***"Increasing object recognition robustness of convolutional neural networks by training on images created by a dream-inspired generative adversarial network"***.

The create_.py scripts were used to make different datasets to train or test the ResNet's performance.


## ACGAN
This folder contains the script for training an AC-GAN on CIFAR-10 images and scripts used to create images by loading a trained generator network checkpoint.

## ResNet
This folder contains the scripts of the ResNet-50 models with different training mixes as well as evaluate.py which was used to generate top-1-performance accuracy measurements and confusion matrices.
